I am an incoming [Computing Innovation Post-doctoral Fellow](https://cifellows2020.org) at Harvard University supervised by [Madhu Sudan](https://madhu.seas.harvard.edu/). I received my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Science Department in 2020 where I was very fortunate to be advised by [Bernhard Haeupler](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~haeupler/). During the summer of 2019, I worked as a research intern at [Microsoft DNA Data Storage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/) group under the supervision of [Sergey Yekhanin](http://www.yekhanin.org/).

I am broadly interested in algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of theoretical computer science. I have been recently working on communication problems concerning synchronization errors.
