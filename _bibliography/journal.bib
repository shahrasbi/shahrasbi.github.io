  abstract={In this paper we define critical graphs as minimal graphs that support a given set of rates for the index coding problem, and study them for both the one-shot and asymptotic setups. For the case of equal rates, we find the critical graph with minimum number of edges for both one-shot and asymptotic cases. For the general case of possibly distinct rates, we show that for one-shot and asymptotic linear index coding, as well as asymptotic non-linear index coding, each critical graph is a union of disjoint strongly connected subgraphs (USCS). On the other hand, we identify a non-USCS critical graph for a one-shot non-linear index coding problem. Next, we identify a few graph structures that are critical. We also generalize some of our results to the groupcast problem. In addition, we show that the capacity region of the index coding is additive for union of disjoint graphs.},
